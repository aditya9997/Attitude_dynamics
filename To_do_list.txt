-Write the main script with:
	-input data script
	-output data script
	-plots section
NOTE: all scripts should be commented with the inputs, outputs, hypotesis used
-Define the geometry and mass
-Optimize the code:
	-Remove all matlab function blocks
	-Write all the blocks in matrix form
	-Use vector concatenate to define the matrices
	-Check for matrices sparsity
	-Optimize solar radiation pressure code by removing collector blocks
	-Optimize quaternion to DCM block by checking which term taken from the diagonal is the highest in value, then choose the inverse mapping rapresentation
-Write some check solution to be used every time we add a new block
-Write a code to plot the ellipsoids and their projection in the coordinate planes
-Write a code to plot the axes during the simulation (quiver3) and attach to it the CAD model of the spacecraft
-Understand how to plot in time the solar exposure of each face of the spacecraft

Lab 8 tasks:
-Set an orbit
-Depending on the orbit model the position of other celestial bodies(if necessary)
-Define the geometry and mass >> we just need the 3 dimensions and the masses >> check if all the components fits in the space and mass requirements

Lab 9 tasks:
-Ask what sensor's positioning means
-Compute the real magnetic field vector from the DCM with error and then compute the tollerance (Giovanni)
-Do the same thing for the gyro (Jorge)
-Attitude determination >> (Aditya)
-Pointing manouvre, point to the Sun/Earth depending on which one is the easier (Davide)
